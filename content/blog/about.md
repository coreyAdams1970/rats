It all started in Tibet, 2006.  Ray Rosales was in search of the famed "13th Note" and taking up residency at a local buddhist colony after years fighting Kumate as "NunSookOw" which translates roughly to "Bad Bass Playing Vato".

Corey Adam Smaller was buskering just down the street in Kathmandu.  Ray would walk by daily and would sometimes sit in on his sitar playing old Donovan songs and share bits of tofu and wheatgrass. 

One day Ray mentioned starting a band of such epic proportions, versatility, and danger that it would need a really dumb name to make itself stand out. 

After going through a rigorous customs ritual involving rubber gloves the duo returned to Utah to start their Dream Band.  Because what better place to seek fame and fortune than Salt Lake City, Utah?  

The name Rage Against the Supremes was thrown out on the flight back, after many Pan-Atlantic Gargle Blasters.  The men never remembered even thinking of the ridiculous name which was a play on words on an already popular band at the time (Soundgarden), until Corey realized it was tattooed on his left buttocks the next day.

"This is the dumbest name ever." Skylar, the lead guitarist and only remnant of House Targaryan,  was rumored to say during one of the many Band Name meetings the future members would have in the opium dens in and around Salt Lake City.

"We need it to be metal. We need it to be mean, but kinda funny, but also self deprecating, and sexy, and mean!  Did I say mean twice? I mean, really really mean!" Thomas the drummer would say, in between hits off his vape-o-mushroom pen.

"No guys, we just need a name. Doesn't matter. We don't need our name to define us! We just can't wear wigs or makeup or masks! I mean this! I won't do it!" Corey the head cheerleader said, exasperated after ten weeks of band name tryouts, wig fittings, and opium den admittance fees.

"That LITERALLY is what a name does!" Ray would argue. 

And around and around they went. Somewhere in the middle there they learned some songs and their instruments.

And just like that:  after months of searching, fighting, more searching, knitting, drinking, winning, losing, winning again, winning some more, ultimately losing and finally admitting defeat, Rage Against the Supremes were born.
