Formed in the ashes of the now de-funked Salty Funk band, Rage Against The Supremes started as a joke. 

"This is the dumbest name ever." The original lead guitarist, Shleppy LackoFunk, was rumored to say during one of the many Band Name meetings the original members would have in the opium dens in and around Salt Lake City.

"We need it to be metal. We need it to be mean!" The original drummer, Ryan K Pedofyle, would scream, in between hits off his vape-o-mushroom pen and Red Bull chaser.  Ryan would later go on to long term mental institution incarceration for his insistence on seeing the ghost of legendary drummer Buddy Rich violating his collection of stuffed animals in various, very-illegal-in-Utah positions.  Ryan would be replaced by Thomas, who, to this day, remains oblivious to the former drummers addictions and sexual preferences.

"No guys, we just need a stupid name. Doesn't matter. We don't need our name to define us!" Corey the founding lead dipshit said, exasperated after ten weeks of band name tryouts and opium den admittance fees.

"That LITERALLY is what a name does!" Ray, the founding father of all-things-bass in the band.

And just like that, RATS was formed.
