<h5>How it began...</h5>

It all started in Tibet, 2006.  Ray was in search of the famed "13th Note" and taking up residency at a local buddhist colony after years fighting Kumate as "NunSookOw" which translates roughly to "Funky Bass Playing Guy".

Corey was buskering just down the street in Kathmandu.  Ray would walk by daily and would sometimes sit in on his sitar playing old Sonny and Cher songs in between bites of  of tofu and wheatgrass. 

One day Ray mentioned starting a band of such epic proportions, such versatility, and such danger that it would need a really dumb name to make itself stand out. 

Twenty years later the duo returned to the States with a slew of heddy cover tunes under their belts.  After going through a rigorous customs ritual involving a garden hose, duct tape , and rubber gloves the duo settled in Utah to start their Dream Band.  

The name Rage Against the Supremes was thrown out on the flight back, after many Pan-Atlantic Gargle Blasters.  The men never remembered even thinking of the ridiculous name which was a play on words on an already popular band at the time (Soundgarden).   Later Corey would discover it was tattooed onto his lower back somehow and remembered.

"This is the dumbest name ever." Skylar, the lead guitarist and only remnant of House Targaryan,  was rumored to say during one of the many band name meetings  they would have in the opium dens in and around Salt Lake City.

"We need it to be metal. We need it to be mean...but kinda funny, ya know? And also self deprecating, and sexy, and mean!  Did I say mean twice? I mean, really really mean!" Thomas the drummer would say, in between hits off his vape-o-mushroom pen.

"No guys, we just need a name. Doesn't matter. And I'm not wearing a wig!" Corey said, exasperated after ten weeks of band name tryouts, wig fittings, and opium den admittance fees.

"That LITERALLY is what a name does!" Ray would argue. 

And around and around they went. Somewhere in the middle there they learned some songs and their instruments and stuff.

And just like that:  after months of soul-searching, cage-fighting, more soul-searching, knitting, drinking, winning, losing, winning again, winning some more, ultimately losing and finally admitting defeat, Rage Against the Supremes were born.
