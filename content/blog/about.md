<h5>How it began...</h5>

It all started in Tibet, 2006.  Ray was in search of the famed "13th Note" and taking up residency at a local buddhist colony after years fighting Kumate as "NunSookOw" which translates roughly to "Funky Bass Playing Guy".

Corey was buskering just down the street in Kathmandu.  Ray would walk by daily and would sometimes sit in on his sitar playing old Sonny and Cher songs in between bites of  of tofu and wheatgrass. 

One day Ray mentioned starting a band of such epic proportions, such versatility, and such danger that it would need a really dumb name to make itself stand out. 

Twenty years later the duo returned to the States with a slew of heddy cover tunes, packets of authentic Kathmandu tofu,  and the will to succeed at Cover Banding.  

After going through a rigorous customs ritual involving a garden hose, duct tape, a nine iron, and rubber gloves, the duo was in Utah.  

The name 'Rage Against the Supremes' was thrown out on the flight back after many double orders of the airlines drink special: The Pan-Atlantic Killer Hornet(a drink of such inspiration inducing epicness it was rumored to once have inspired Jimmy Page to start the band that would change the world: The Firm). 

The ridiculous name which was a play on words on an already popular band at the time (Soundgarden) was brought up at the fiftieth or so  'Band Meeting To Discuss Stupid Names' held at the local Denny's on 600 south and main. Booth three. Section one. 

"This is the dumbest name I have ever, EVER heard!" Skylar, the lead guitarist and only remnant of House Targaryan,  was rumored to utter.

"We need it to be metal. We need it to be mean...but kinda funny, ya know? And also self deprecating, but sexy, and mean!  Did I say mean twice? I mean, really, really mean!" Thomas the drummer would ramble, in between hits off his vape-o-mushroom pen.

"No guys, we just need a name. Doesn't matter. And I'm not wearing a wig!" Corey declared, exasperated after ten weeks of band name tryouts, wig fittings, and opium den admittance fees.

"Ok, fine. I give up, let's just go with that ridiculous name you were screaming into the telecom on the flight back before the sky marshall tackled you." Ray would interject, in between bites of fried Kathmandu tofu.

And just like that:  after months of soul-searching, cage-fighting, more soul-searching, knitting, drinking, winning, losing, winning again, winning some more, ultimately losing and finally admitting defeat, Rage Against the Supremes were born.
