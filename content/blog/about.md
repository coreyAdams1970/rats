<h3>About</h3>
It all started in Tibet, 2006.  Ray was in search of the famed "13th Note" and taking up residency at a local buddhist colony after years fighting in Kumate as "NunSookOw" which translates roughly to "Bad Bass Playing Vato".

Corey was buskering in Kathmandu, just down the street from the buddhist colony.  Ray would walk by daily and would sit in on scitar for old Donovan songs and share bits of tofu. 

One day Ray mentioned starting a band of such epic proportions and versatility that it would need a really dumb name to make itself stand out. 

After going through a rigorous customs ritual involving rubber gloves the duo returned to Utah to start their Dream Band.  Because what better place to seek fame and fortune than Salt Lake City?  

The name Rage Against the Supremes was thrown out on the flight back, after many, many Pan-Atlantic Gargle Blasters.  The boys never remembered even thinking of the ridiculous play on words on an already popular band at the time (Soundgarden), until Corey realized it was tattooed on his left buttocks.

"This is the dumbest name ever." The original lead guitarist, Shleppy LackoFunk, was rumored to say during one of the many Band Name meetings the original members would have in the opium dens in and around Salt Lake City.

"We need it to be metal. We need it to be mean!" The original drummer Ryan  would scream, in between hits off his vape-o-mushroom pen and Red Bull chaser.  Ryan would later go on to long term mental institution incarceration for his insistence on seeing the ghost of legendary drummer Buddy Rich violating his collection of stuffed animals in various, very-illegal-in-Utah positions.  

Ryan would be replaced by Thomas, who, to this day, remains oblivious to the former drummers addictions and furry obsessions, but has awesome hair and plays a mean, steady funky beat sure to make your bar mitzvah a hit.

"No guys, we just need a stupid name. Doesn't matter. We don't need our name to define us!" Corey the head cheerleader said, exasperated after ten weeks of band name tryouts and opium den admittance fees.

"That LITERALLY is what a name does!" Ray, the founding father of all-things-bass in the band.

And just like that:  after months of searching, fighting, more searching, drinking, and admitting defeat, Rage Against the Supremes were born.
