Just came back after a whirlwind trip to Wisconsin to play at our friend Charles' birthday. What a gig!  After taking a red eye into Detroit and laid over for hours, sleeping on the floor of the airport, we arrived in time for a quick nap and much coffee before rocking Milwaukee.  It was a great gig with great sound and a better crowd. Milwaukee knows how to party!
