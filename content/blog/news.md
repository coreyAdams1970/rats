UPDATE:

**Our guitarist Skyler had a completely blown out dislocated shoulder. We decided to cancel our busy gig schedule for January and February. Corey is going to Golden BC Canada in March so we probably won't be back until the end of season in Park City.**  

But Don't worry!  We are already working on new tunes for your ear hole. Hope to see you soon. Go over to our [contact](www.ratsband.com/contact) page and drop us a line.  Love to hear from you!
